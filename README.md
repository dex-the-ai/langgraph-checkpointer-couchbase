# LangGraph Checkpoint Couchbase

A Couchbase implementation of the LangGraph `CheckpointSaver` interface that enables persisting agent state and conversation history in a Couchbase database.

## Overview

This package provides a seamless way to persist LangGraph agent states in Couchbase, enabling:
- State persistence across application restarts
- Retrieval of historical conversation steps
- Continued conversations from previous checkpoints
- Both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph-checkpointer-couchbase
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Couchbase Server (7.0+ recommended)
- Couchbase Python SDK 4.6.3+
- LangGraph 1.0.5+
- LangChain 1.1.3+ and LangChain OpenAI 1.1.3+

## Prerequisites

- A running Couchbase cluster
- A bucket created for storing checkpoints
- Appropriate credentials with read/write access

## Quick Start

First, set up your agent tools and model:

```python
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")


tools = [get_weather]
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5-mini", temperature=0)
```

### Synchronous Usage

```python
import os
from langgraph_checkpointer_couchbase import CouchbaseSaver
from langchain.agents import create_agent

with CouchbaseSaver.from_conn_info(
        cb_conn_str=os.getenv("CB_CLUSTER") or "couchbase://localhost",
        cb_username=os.getenv("CB_USERNAME") or "Administrator",
        cb_password=os.getenv("CB_PASSWORD") or "password",
        bucket_name=os.getenv("CB_BUCKET") or "test",
        scope_name=os.getenv("CB_SCOPE") or "langgraph",
    ) as checkpointer:
    # Create the agent with checkpointing
    graph = create_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    
    # Configure with a unique thread ID
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    
    # Run the agent
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config)
    
    # Retrieve checkpoints
    latest_checkpoint = checkpointer.get(config)
    latest_checkpoint_tuple = checkpointer.get_tuple(config)
    checkpoint_tuples = list(checkpointer.list(config))

    print(latest_checkpoint)
    print(latest_checkpoint_tuple)
    print(checkpoint_tuples)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

```python
import os
from acouchbase.cluster import Cluster as ACluster
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.options import ClusterOptions
from langgraph_checkpointer_couchbase import AsyncCouchbaseSaver
from langchain.agents import create_agent

auth = PasswordAuthenticator(
    os.getenv("CB_USERNAME") or "Administrator",
    os.getenv("CB_PASSWORD") or "password",
)
options = ClusterOptions(auth)
cluster = await ACluster.connect(os.getenv("CB_CLUSTER") or "couchbase://localhost", options)

bucket_name = os.getenv("CB_BUCKET") or "test"
scope_name = os.getenv("CB_SCOPE") or "langgraph"

async with AsyncCouchbaseSaver.from_cluster(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=bucket_name,
        scope_name=scope_name,
    ) as checkpointer:
    # Create the agent with checkpointing
    graph = create_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    
    # Configure with a unique thread ID
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
    
    # Run the agent asynchronously
    res = await graph.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in nyc")]}, config
    )

    # Retrieve checkpoints asynchronously
    latest_checkpoint = await checkpointer.aget(config)
    latest_checkpoint_tuple = await checkpointer.aget_tuple(config)
    checkpoint_tuples = [c async for c in checkpointer.alist(config)]

    print(latest_checkpoint)
    print(latest_checkpoint_tuple)
    print(checkpoint_tuples)

# Close the cluster when done
await cluster.close()
```

## Recommended Indexes

The saver creates the `checkpoints` and `checkpoint_writes` collections on first use, but not indexes. Without them, queries fall back to sequential scans, which are slow on large collections and may not return a checkpoint written immediately before. Create these indexes once per scope (replace `test` and `langgraph` with your bucket and scope):

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_checkpoints_thread IF NOT EXISTS
  ON `test`.`langgraph`.`checkpoints`(thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_checkpoint_writes_thread IF NOT EXISTS
  ON `test`.`langgraph`.`checkpoint_writes`(thread_id, checkpoint_ns, checkpoint_id);
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| CB_CLUSTER | Couchbase connection string | couchbase://localhost |
| CB_USERNAME | Username for Couchbase | Administrator |
| CB_PASSWORD | Password for Couchbase | password |
| CB_BUCKET | Bucket to store checkpoints | test |
| CB_SCOPE | Scope within bucket | langgraph |

## Running the Tests

The checkpointer tests run against a live Couchbase cluster and do not need an LLM. Create the bucket, scope, and the [recommended indexes](#recommended-indexes) first, then:

```bash
pip install -e . pytest pytest-asyncio
export CB_CLUSTER=couchbase://localhost CB_USERNAME=Administrator CB_PASSWORD=password CB_BUCKET=test CB_SCOPE=langgraph
pytest tests/test_checkpointer.py
```

The end-to-end agent example in `tests/agent_e2e_test.py` additionally requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
python tests/agent_e2e_test.py
```
